RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play a crucial role in the regulation of RNA after transcription. A key 
aspect of post-transcriptional gene regulation involves identifying RBP binding sites and understanding 
their interactions. Many computational approaches have been employed to model RBP binding 
preferences, yet obtaining a complete three-dimensional representation remains a significant challenge. 
Recently, deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for predicting RBP binding sites and modeling 
structural preferences. By leveraging deep learning, researchers can analyze complex structural features 
embedded in RNA sequences and profiles, helping to identify new binding sites and motifs. One of the 
main challenges lies in fully characterizing the three-dimensional structure of RBPs' binding targets. 
Deep learning techniques can extract and predict these intricate features, offering new insights into 
binding site preferences. Among the datasets used for RNA-protein binding site predictions are 
CLIPSEQ_ELAVL1 and ALKBH5_Baltz2012. The CLIPSEQ_ELAVL1 dataset, derived from CLIP
seq experiments, identifies RNA regions bound by ELAVL1 (HuR), a protein that stabilizes mRNAs, 
particularly those with AU-rich elements (AREs) in their 3' UTRs. This dataset is valuable for studying 
post-transcriptional gene regulation, especially in contexts like cancer and immune responses. 
Meanwhile, the ALKBH5_Baltz2012 dataset centers on ALKBH5, an RNA demethylase responsible 
for removing N6-methyladenosine (m6A) from mRNAs, offering insights into epitranscriptomic 
regulation with potential relevance to cancer and reproductive biology.
